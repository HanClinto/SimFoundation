# Provisional Site Campaign

Run `npm run sim` from `src_web`. `brief` introduces the finite home site;
`status` shows personnel, supplies, route gates, transit blockers and findings.
`brief blackwood`, `brief gallery` and `brief kestrel` explain the next work.
Use `site home` or the route name to inspect a retained site.

The home begins with Alex, Ben and Casey, eight meals, four round-trip transport
allocations, a reusable field kit, a comparison bench, independent records,
ordinary rest furniture and a glass display bay. No campaign command deploys
new staff. Home routines can be enabled with `autonomy casey on`.

Prepare an actual team:

```text
prepare blackwood alex ben
step 12
send blackwood alex ben
step 8
site blackwood
```

Preparation is ordinary walking, not instant departure. Queued work must finish
or be cancelled first; `queue alex` explains blockers. Staff take their carried
objects with them. Each carrier can hold one object, so kit/supplies compete
with evidence. One ground docket beside home pad (2,7) is spent only on an
accepted outbound departure. Return trips are prepaid even if dockets run out.
Keep the home arrival pad clear; blocked arrivals remain in transit and continue
physiology until admitted.

Recover Blackwood's journal and specimen, then `prepare home alex ben`, wait
for walking, and `send home alex ben`. At home, delegate
`order alex deliver journal 3 3` and `order ben deliver specimen 3 5`.
After delivery, `order ben study bench marsh-lead` requires both objects and the
two independent records near the bench for physical work. The dated finding
opens the Kestrel depot; merely collecting every map marker does not.

For the depot survey, carry `kit` to Kestrel and `order alex study station
depot-survey`. Leaving the reusable kit there frees a return carrier for meals.
Recovered `dockets` must be delivered beside the home pad to fund future trips.
All removed supplies remain removed on revisit.

The gallery route recovers SCP-1370 without combat. Deliver `exhibit` to home
(13,3), `order alex study display safe-exhibit`, then walk outside the bay so
its door can close. The exhibit retains its original pawn identity.

## Cooperative Care Transfer

`brief care` describes an original closing aid station, not an SCP article.
Mira accepts escort but not direct pawn orders. Her minor wound bleeds at
0.1 blood loss per tick, including while unattended. Casey has two finite
stabilization charges. A medic should `order casey treat mira` before
`order casey escort mira 2 3`. The responder approaches and the person walks on
her own turn. Escort places the person at the exact destination and yields
the tile rather than stacking them.

When both queues finish in the loading area, `send home casey mira` transfers
both actual people; there is at most one walking passenger per group. At home,
`order casey escort mira 6 2`, wait for arrival, then `admit mira bed`.
Admission requires proximity and stopped bleeding, queues ordinary rest and
enables home needs autonomy. Injury and lost blood remain; Mira is a resident,
not a cloned staff recruit.

Cancel the leader's escort to release following on the next tick. The person
stays where she is. If she becomes incapable, stabilize and carry her through
ordinary `take` and staff preparation instead; do not list a carried passenger
again in `send`. Incapacitated bed care is not yet implemented. A partial
withdrawal leaves the same patient at the same persistent site, with no reset.

The [care-transfer walkthrough](tests/care-transfer.txt) uses normal commands:

```sh
npm run sim < src/simulation/catalog/campaign/tests/care-transfer.txt
```

`save <new-path>` and `restore <path>` preserve the entire ongoing session,
including in-progress delivery/study and transit. Success does not stop the
campaign; partial recovery does not reset a site. Development saves are
disposable and only current versions load.

The [home-loop walkthrough](tests/home-loop.txt) is a normal-command,
test-only example of recovery, home study, equipment use and supply return:

```sh
npm run sim < src/simulation/catalog/campaign/tests/home-loop.txt
```

## Attribution And Limits

Blackwood evidence adapts [SCP-1867 by Djoric](../quests/scp1867/README.md);
the gallery adapts [SCP-1370 by Sorts](../quests/scp1370/README.md), both under
CC BY-SA 3.0. Their source/adaptation notes also appear in object inspection.
This campaign, Kestrel depot and the transport agreement are original game
fiction offered under the same license, not canonical SCP events. No images
are included.

The home also hosts a [bounded SCP-294 experiment](../quests/scp294/README.md),
with finite paid requests and source-conserving samples. Use `brief scp294`.

This slice has no death, hostile capture, vehicle simulation or automatic
resupply. Incapacitated staff can be carried by available responders
through existing physical rules, but treatment currently stabilizes bleeding
only; it is not a full recovery model. There is no authored combat in these
campaign routes. Running out of every transport allocation prevents additional
departures, not prepaid return or continued home management.
